                        <h4 id="title_intro_para">The Internet of things (IoT) is a name for the aggregate collection of network-enabled devices, excluding traditional computers like laptops and servers. Types of network connections can include Wi-Fi connections and Bluetooth
                            connections. The IoT includes devices such as “smart” appliances, like refrigerators and thermostats; home security systems; webcams and, printers. Many more smart devices such as Apple watches, routers, and smart speaking
                            devices like Amazon Echo and Google Home. Over the last decade, Internet has made a significant and major impact on our economy. The IoT brings remarkable communication and networking infrastructure. The world-wide-web has
                            been a major driver of global information and media sharing. From Desktop networking Internet is continuing to become more elegant, with the advent of low-cost broadband connection. The “Internet of Things” for which the web
                            will provide a medium for physical world objects to participate in the interaction. Thus, the digital way of networking can pave the way for the physical world to enter the online world to provide a common platform. These devices
                            use Internet protocol (Ip), the same protocol that identifies computers over the world wide web and allows them to communicate with one another.</div>

                            IoT plays a major role in almost the industries. For example, we know that in every classroom there will be some students who may have a vision problem and are not able to see far objects or writing on the board. But in a smart classroom, the laptop of
                            each student is connected to a network to which the projector is also connected. So, all the information displayed on the board in the classroom is easily visible to the students on their laptops. This way the problem of students
                            with a vision problem can see clearer. People are now wearing a health-tracking wristband, which is a product of IoT. This band is continuously tracking and gathering information about the person’s health condition and transferring
                            it to the mobile phone of the same person as a notification so that he/she can provide his/her medical feedback. If the condition of the person suddenly shows some abnormalities, then he can easily save by this IoT concept.
                            If the person’s health is abnormal, it shows a notification. Now if the person can click on the button, then he will connect to the nearby hospital and then will be immediately treated.</p>

                            Although their many advantages it also has many risks. It can be easily exposed to hacking. For example, a hacker can access all personal and health information by hacking into the network. Any device connecting to the Internet with an operating system
                            comes with the possibility of being compromised, in turn becoming a backdoor for hackers. To improve security, an IoT device needs to be directly accessible over the internet, should be made into its network, and restricted
                            network access. The best way to give security to IoT is to secure the network in which several devices are connected rather than giving security to Internet. It will be good if the security is implemented in an encrypted manner
                            so that if a hacker in any way is can hack the network, he will not be able to get the required information as it is encrypted.</p>
