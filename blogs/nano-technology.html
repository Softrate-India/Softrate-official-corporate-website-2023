                            on our daily lives. Nanotechnology is a contemporary science, engineering, and technology that deals with nanometers.

                                All the experiments are conducted at the nanoscale (1-100 nanometers) by scientists. To furnish you with a clear example, a single sheet of newspaper is 1,00,000 nanometers thick, and a human hair is in the thickness of 80,000 nanometers. Just imagine
                                scientists are working with just 1-100 nanometers!! A unit nanometer is equivalent to a billionth of a meter.

                                laid its footprints in various fields and things that are enormously useful to us and the environment. Let's review those domains one over the other. Let’s deep dive into the various fields of nanotechnology!</p>

                                Our ultimate goal is to lessen pollution and to preserve our environment! The significant applications using nanotechnology are wastewater purification using nanobubbles and air purification with ions. It practices two ways to reduce air pollution: Catalysts
                                and nanostructured membranes. Catalysts manufactured from nanoparticles have a wide surface area as they modify vapors escaping from cars and industries into harmless gasses.

                                On the flip side, Nanostructured materials are under development and can segregate carbon dioxide released from industries and vehicles. Nanobubbles are miniature gas bubbles present in a liquid. They have unique physical properties viz. high internal
                                pressure, longevity, generation of free radicals. Nanobubbles perform an indefinite role in wastewater treatment by performing nanobubble oxidation, surfactant removal, and transfer of hyper-efficient gas.

                                Smart fabrics or E-textiles have been developed that don’t stain or wrinkle.

                                the temperature of the body. For example, it behaves as a woolen jacket during winter and cotton cloth during the summer season.

                                Nanotechnology plays an inevitable part in the field of medicine, and it is also known as nanomedicine. This feature will revolutionize the way doctors detect and treat diseases in the human body and involve a lot of techniques. In which, the most vital
                                one is the treatment of neurodegenerative disease or cancer. Particles and drugs used in nanomedicine can attack the cancer cells without harming the other healthy cells and allows for earlier detection of disease. Nanotechnology
                                is also used in antibacterial treatments by killing bacteria using Gold nanoparticles and infrared light. Chips consisting of carbon nanotubes attached with the antibodies are used in detecting cancer cells in the bloodstream.
                                Some of the nanoparticles are also being used to enhance pharmaceutical products such as sunscreen.

                                they can replace silicon in the field of electronics. Smaller, faster, and more efficient microchips and devices, additionally, lighter, stronger, and more conductive quantum nanowires are also being manufactured by scientists
                                with the help of carbon nanotubes.

                                Every living organism eats food to survive. We always eat the same sorts of food which depends upon our lifestyle and other provisions. Nanotechnology is also involved in the food industry. The nanostructured food ingredients are being developed by scientists
                                that offer refined taste, texture, and consistency. Nanotechnology will be reducing the wastage of food from microbial injections, as it can prolong the shelf life of each food.

                            <p> Increasing needs of nanoparticles in food technology include food processing, food packaging, food safety, etc., Nano biosensors can detect the presence of pathogens in food. Nanoclays and nanofilms are the barrier materials
                                employed in food packaging. They inhibit deterioration and oxygen absorption.
