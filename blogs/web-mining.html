                            applications of the data mining techniques, it has helped to analyze user activities on different web pages and track them over a period of time. Basically, Web Usage Mining can be divided into 2 major subcategories based on

                        <li class="nav-link btn bg-light" key="1">The most criticized ethical issue involving web usage mining is the invasion of privacy. Privacy is considered lost when information concerning an individual is obtained, used, or disseminated, especially if this occurs without
                            the individual's knowledge or consent. The obtained data will be analyzed, made anonymous, then clustered to form anonymous profiles.
                        </li>

                        <li class="nav-link btn bg-light" key="2">These applications de-individualize users by judging them by their mouse clicks rather than by identifying information. De-individualization, in general, can be defined as a tendency of judging and treating people on the basis
                            of group characteristics instead of on their own individual characteristics and merits. </li>
                        <li class="nav-link btn bg-light" key="2">Companies can establish better customer relationships by understanding the needs of the customer better and reacting to customer needs faster. Companies can find, attract and retain customers; they can save on production costs

                        <li class="nav-link btn bg-light" key="2">Another important concern is that the companies collecting the data for a specific purpose might use the data for totally different purposes, and this essentially violates the user's interests.
