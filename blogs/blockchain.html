                            provides the securest system where individuals can deal directly with someone without an intercessor or a third party.

                                Blockchain is a growing list of records called blocks that are interconnected with each other through cryptography. Each block holds three components such as a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and the transaction data. Blockchain
                                is a type of Distributed Ledger Technology, a digital system for recording the transactions at multiple places at the same time, which records all the transactions using hash, a cryptographic signature, and ledgers that
                                use distributive systems to verify these online transactions.

                                BAAS, a very well-managed blockchain platform where buyers can build their blockchain application, and the vendor supplies the tools for constructing this with good infrastructure. These principles are similar to Software as a service. The introduction
                                and implementation of BAAS gradually stimulated the adoption of Digital Ledger Technologies through blockchain in many companies and businesses. BAAS also can provide both hosting services and professional assistance. It
                                would be very challenging to set up a small organization with bounded IT resources. So it is preferable for everyone. This Blockchain with BAAS will play a notable role in shaping the business of the future.

                                A cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency used to buy online goods and services. It uses an online ledger or record with cryptography and also secures online transactions. Most of the companies have launched their cryptocurrencies called tokens used
                                for online trading. You are supposed to exchange real currency for cryptocurrency for accessing goods and services. These cryptocurrencies predominantly work under the technology of blockchain. Through blockchain, the companies
                                hold the record of online transactions of cryptocurrencies and also provide security.

                                The significant supremacy of this Cryptocurrency is to transfer funds to someone without any third-party interference. While this is also involved in many transactions like tax evasion and money laundering. So, this cryptocurrency is either legal or illegal
                                it purely depends upon the country. Bitcoin is the most popular and first blockchain-based cryptocurrency. It has a very high worth and is used extensively in online trading.

                                Generally, cyber security is a practice of safeguarding computers, servers, networks from malicious attacks. Even though many cyber malware attacks are happening. Innumerable attacks are executed on social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook
                                where large personal data is hacked and infringed. To avoid these cyberattacks, blockchain technology with the integration of cyber security must be implemented in those messaging systems. It potentially strengthens cybersecurity
                                and makes a suspicious one to a trusted environment.

                                The banking and health care industry has become prey to cyberattacks. Hackers easily hack the information of the patient’s health report and bank credentials (credit card details, account details) and sell them to someone for money. It also can be averted
                                by Blockchain technology. It allows storing information that can be accessed only by the credentialed professionals and officials and through which cybercriminals cannot access the information.

                                Artificial Intelligence uses computers to do things that require human intelligence. Blockchain-AI confluence is ultimately inescapable in the field of computer technology as both deal with data and values. AI can examine and generate insights from data
                                to produce values. Blockchain provides secure storage and sharing of data and value. It can also assure the trustworthiness of the data before AI extricates insights from those data. Because of Blockchain, AI models are
                                improving a lot nowadays. The evolving idea of the researchers is to collaborate Machine learning with blockchain.
