                                Before grasping more about Soft Computing, let us know what Hard computing is. Hard-computing is a process where computers solve problems using mathematical algorithms and yield a precise output value. Here, the control action is a mathematical model,
                                and it is unambiguous. An elementary example of Hard computing is solving a numerical problem. The peculiarities of Hard computing are beneficial. Then why do we need and use Soft Computing?

                                Soft computing is a type of computing model developed to resolve the non-linear issues that include imprecise, vague, precise, and approximate solutions of a muddle. The term Soft Computing was coined by Lotfi A.Zadeh in the 1980s. It is an emerging strategy
                                that deals with approximation models and gives solutions to real-world problems. The Striking fact is that it can map a human mind with another human mind.

                                Soft computing aids the users by solving real-world complications by rendering approximate but precise solutions. The algorithms used in Soft Computing are flexible and adaptive. The hypothesis of Soft Computing relies on learning from the experimental
                                data. It doesn't require any mathematical models(used in Hard computing) to solve real-world problems. The concept of Soft Computing utterly depends upon the concepts such as Fuzzy Logic, Artificial Neural Networks, genetic
                                algorithms, and expert systems.

                                for solving this. But it is 75% identical according to Soft Computing. Soft computing does not provide an accurate solution but a precise one. Now one can understand the discrepancy between hard computing and soft computing.

                                a machine can think like a human mind. It can analyze the problems, make decisions, and bring out a comprehensive solution. Artificial Neural Networks are a mathematical model implemented neurally and are associated with

                                logic helps businessmen to make decisions accurately. The answers for 'Have you completed the task?' will be either Yes or No, but when fuzzy logic is applied, there will be more solutions like, yes, going to complete,
                                not yet started, etc., This logic is related to Soft Computing as it also provides an approximate and precise key to the problem. Soft Computing with the Fuzzy Logic approaches on the concept of how a computer would make

                                of computation. They are usually used to generate high-quality solutions for optimization problems.
