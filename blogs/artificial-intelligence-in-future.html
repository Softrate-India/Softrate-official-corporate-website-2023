                            thinking. It is probably the most growing industry. Furthermore, many researchers believe that AI could solve a more difficult problems and help in a crisis situation. In the future Artificial Intelligence will be replacing
                            humans in a majority of the works by selling goods, writing books or novels, performing surgeries, etc. AI will become an integral part of our lives will become super intelligent than a human being.</h4>
