                                Let’s get started. Many of you have wondered what is cloud computing? Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers,
                                you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, the definition of cloud computing is <span>“A distributed
                                digital infrastructural resource that delivers hosted services by way of the internet”</span>. </p>

                                The cloud computing service sector has become a rapidly growing multibillion-dollar industry. To put this into perspective, Gartner estimates cloud spending will reach $260 billion by the end of 2018. That’s a huge amount right. Another interesting fact
                                is Gartner is not alone in highlighting cloud computing’s growing prevalence in the market. The dynamic effects of cloud adoption are already playing out and are most evident in the three wide-ranging and common models
                                of cloud computing services: software-as-a-service (SaaS),infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), and platform-as-a-service (PaaS). Another defining cloud characteristic is that the computing, storage, networking, and integration
                                capabilities of each SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS offering are effectively owned by the vendor and delivered as a service on an on-demand, subscription basis to the customer.

                                Referred to as the “on-demand software,” SaaS is the most commonly used service for business customers. With a wide variety of application and service types, SaaS is replacing or augmenting traditional enterprise systems including ERP, accounting, human
                                resources management, content management systems, supply chain and inventory management, and customer relationship management (CRM) programs. Since SaaS doesn’t require purchasing an expensive licensed program, users can
                                access numerous cloud applications on an as-needed basis

                                The IaaS layer offers essential building blocks, database storage, and a virtual platform. By building cost-saving and scalable IT solutions, the complex and expensive hardware is outsourced to a third-party cloud vendor. All of these IT components are
                                automated for customers who are able to self-provision the storage or processing power of the IaaS platforms.

                            <p>Today’s business environment relies more and more on devices with Internet of Things capabilities (especially smartphones and tablets). As a result, a majority of offices are essentially becoming virtual workspaces. Therefore,
                                easier and more efficient access to data is possible through cloud computing.
                            </p>
                            <p>A recent study by a market research company revealed that cloud computing is having a measurable business impact. Companies that have implemented cloud services have seen a nearly 21 percent increase in speed to market, a 19
                                percent jump in process efficiency, and a 20 percent uptick in company growth. Here are even more advantages of cloud computing:</p>

                            <p> Cloud computing reduces cost by leveraging economies of scale. A Booz Allen Hamilton study found that the cloud approach could reduce costs by 50 to 67% for the deployment of 1000 servers. Cloud customers can take advantage
                                of lower costs from vendors’ economies of scale, reducing their investments in on-premises infrastructure.</p>

                                will consume some form of cloud service, signaling that inevitably most applications and enterprise information flows will be cloud-based. The cloud will become more than just a consumption model – it will be central to

                            <p> To conclude, Cloud computing is the latest technology that promises immense benefits. However, a lot of research is still required in this area as many of the concerns related to security and privacy issues have not been answered
                                by the experts and remain open. However, there is a lot of research and investment in the area by the Information technology giants like Microsoft, Google, Cisco, IBM in this area and the day is not far when the cloud will
                                be widely adopted and all the security and privacy issues will be handled. Hope you would have understood the concept. See you in yet another blog.
